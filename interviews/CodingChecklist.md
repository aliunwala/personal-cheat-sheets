# General Purpose Coding Checklists

## Converting Junior Code to Senior Level Code
1. Functional Requirments
    - If you are fetching data you need loading/error state (can do it with state or react query)
        - loading : wraps the fetch
        - error:  try/catch wraps the promise
    - For alternative path logic return early.

        - For example loading/error cases can use if statement with a return. This early return happens before "golden path" return statement.
